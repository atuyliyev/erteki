# Erteki
Storytelling by Children

*Erteki* is an immersive installation, which listens to childrenâ€™s stories and illustrates them live, using speech recognition, machine learning and projection. *Erteki*, or fairy tale in Turkmen language, is designed to make stories and characters come to life in a magical experience. 

*Erteki* is a master's thesis project by Akmyrat Tuyliyev at the Interactive Telecommunication's Program (ITP) of NYU Tisch School of the Arts. Read more at:

### Project details

Erteki is a Javascript project. The listening part is run by P5 Speech, which utilizes Web Speech API. The illustrations are supplied by drawings from the "Quick Draw", Google's large open-source data set of doodles. To amplify and diversify the linguistics of the project, the latest update includes a Thesaurus dataset of synonyms. 

Currently in the works: 
- saving and restarting options, 
- size differences and
- letting the users specify colors of the doodles.
